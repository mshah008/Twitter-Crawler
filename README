This project tries to:
1- gather information about twitter accounts and their followship connection by
crawling twitter.
2- detect the notion of communities among the users by building the followship
graph and extracting cliques and merging the very similar cliques into a
community.

To crawl twitter, the program mine_twitter_for_trends_tosend.py is used. This
program accepts as its commandline arguments, a set of twitter account names
that will be used to seed the crawling. It should be noticed that if an account
is not public (or is private) on twitter, its information will not be retrieved,
because twitter does not return the connection information of private accounts.
The model.py is the data model used by elixir library, used in
mine_twitter_for_trends_tosend.py.
